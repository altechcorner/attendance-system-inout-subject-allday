To serve your frontend (like upload.html) without using "Go Live" in VS Code, you can use a simple static file server. Here are the most common and easy ways:

1. Use Node.js with Express (Recommended for your project)
Since you already have an Express backend, you can serve your frontend files from a folder (e.g., frontend) by adding this to your server.js:

// ...existing code...
const path = require('path');

// Serve static frontend files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend')));

// ...existing code...

Restart your backend server.
Now you can access your frontend at:
http://localhost:3000/upload.html

2. Use Python's built-in HTTP server
If you have Python installed, run this in your project root (where frontend is):

cd frontend
python -m http.server 5500


Then open:
http://localhost:5500/upload.html

3. Use npx serve (Node.js, no install needed)
If you have Node.js, run:

npx serve frontend

Then open the link it gives you (usually http://localhost:3000/upload.html).

Summary:

The easiest for your setup is to use Express's express.static to serve your frontend.
Or use Python or npx serve for a quick static server.
